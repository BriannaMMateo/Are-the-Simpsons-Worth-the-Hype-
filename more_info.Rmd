```

Even though each member of the family was very special, we were curious in finding out who had the most lines across the 600 episodes. Not surprisingly, Homer Simpson led the list followed by his wife, Marge. Though we were expecting Lisa to have more lines, it turns out Bart had more lines than her. 
However, the number of lines does not equal the number of words spoken by each character. After all, “D’oh!” is a line, but only counts as one word. This is where Marge and Lisa take over the top five of the characters who spoke the most throughout the episodes. Besides them, Robert Pinsky, an American essayist, and poet is also one of the characters with most words to have been spoken, most likely due to the episode where he reads poetry in a Cafe.

This US choropleth map displays the amount of times each state was mentioned across all episodes of The Simpsons. Although our team aren’t avid fans of the show, it's no secret that The Simpsons can become very political. The team predicted that more of the big states, like California, Florida, or Washington would have way more mentions than what shows. However, they often talk about New York with over 80 mentions! I was in huge shock that Hawaii made it to the Top 3, with close to 40 mentions, along with Texas with about 38 mentions. 
Now that we know what states are most talked about, let’s figure out where in the Simpsons is the most popular location?

## Where Does Most Of The Show Take Place? 
![](springfield.png){width=50%}

```{r}



##wrangle for top 10 locations they were in 
simpsons_pop<- simpsons_script_lines %>%
  group_by(raw_location_text)%>%
  summarize(count=n())%>%
 top_n(n = 10, wt = count)%>%
  arrange(desc(count))



##make PLOT FOR THE LOCATIONS :)
locations_plot<-ggplot(data =simpsons_pop, mapping = aes(y = reorder(raw_location_text, count),x=count,fill=raw_location_text)) +
  geom_col()+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#2f64d6", "#F21900", "#9c5b01","#ff81c1","#f8db27","#ed37de","#55a0bb","#eecd80","#77AAEF","#108571"))+
   labs(title="TOP 10 Popular Locations ",
     subtitle="Where Was The Most Common Location?",
    x="Count",y="Locations")
#remove legend
  locations_plot+ theme(legend.position="none")
```

This bar plot displays the top 10 most common locations in The Simpsons. With no surprise, we see that the Simpsons Home is where most of the scenes happen with over 30,000 times a scene has taken place there.  We see that Springfield Elementary School is the second most common location, assuming those are the scenes with the other main characters Bart and Lisa. We find it interesting that Springfield Street made it in the top 10, as it’s not specific to exactly where in Springfield, it's just labeled as a street. Other popular locations include Moe’s Tavern, (where Homer relieves most of his stress), Springfield Nuclear Power Plant(Homer’s Job),the  Kwik-E-Mart, and First Church of Springfield. 

## Conclusion
In conclusion, America’s favorite fictional family made their mark within the Television industry for about 32 years.  With over 600 episodes, my team and I wanted to dive deeper into the show by asking our most curious questions. After analyzing the data, it’s safe to say that The Simpsons deserves the hype.^[Banerjee, Prashant. “The Simpsons Dataset.” Kaggle, March 14, 2020. https://www.kaggle.com/prashant111/the-simpsons-dataset.] ^[“The Simpsons.”  Wikipedia.
